# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

In many eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, the genome is tightly packed and organized with the help of nucleosomes (heterochromatin). A nucleosome is a complex formed by eight histone proteins that is wrapped with DNA. If the DNA is transcribed into RNA, the DNA will be opened and loosened from the nucleosome complex (euchromatin). Many factors, such as the chromatin structure, the position of the nucleosomes, and histone modifications, play an important role in the organization and accessibility of the DNA. Consequently, these factors are also important for the activation and inactivation of genes. **Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing ([ATAC-Seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATAC-seq))** is a method to investigate the accessibility of chromatin and thus a method to determine regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. The method can help identify promoter regions and potential enhancers and silencers. A promoter is the DNA region close to the transcription start site. It contains binding sites for transcription factors that will recruit the RNA polymerase. An enhancer is a DNA region that can be located up to 1 Mb downstream or upstream of the promoter. When transcription factors bind it and contact a promoter region, the transcription of the gene is increased. In contrast, a silencer decreases or inhibits the gene's expression.

![ATAC-Seq](../../images/atac-seq/atac-seq.jpeg "Buenrostro et al. 2013 Nat Methods")

In order to find accessible (open) chromatin regions, the genome is treated with an enzyme called Tn5, which is a transposase. A [transposase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposase) can bind to a [transposable element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element), which is a DNA sequence that can change its position (jump) within a genome (read the two links to get a deeper insight). With the help of Tn5 we introduce adapters into the genome and concurrently, the DNA is sheared by the transposase activity. The read library is then prepared for sequencing, including PCR amplification and purification steps. 

As a result, we obtain reads from open chromatin regions. ATAC-Seq uses paired-end reads. That means, two reads with two different adapters sequencing the extremities of a fragment which spans a certain distance. However, we also have fragments that span one nucleosome or more. As you can imagine, these fragments span a bigger distance than most of the fragments from open chromatin regions (with no nucleosome). Thus, we can filter the reads based on this distance in the analysis.

## Data
In this tutorial we will use data from the study of [Buenrostro et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959825), the first paper on ATAC-Seq. The data is from a human cell line of purified CD4+ T cells, called GM12878. The original dataset had 2 x 200 million reads and this would be too big to process in a training session. So, we downsampled the original dataset to 200,000 randomly selected reads. We also added about 200,000 reads pairs that will map to chromosome 22 to have a good profile on a chromosome, similar to what you might get with a typical ATAC-seq sample (2 x 20 million reads in original fastq). Furthermore, we want to compare the predicted open chromatin regions to known binding sites of a transcriptional repressor called [CTCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTCF). This will help us to find sites that are potential silencer regions. For that reason, we will download predicted sites of CTCF from ENCODE (ENCSR361KVZ, dataset ENCFF049IPS).

# Preprocessing

## Get Data

We first need to download the reads (fastqs) as well as other annotation files. Then, to increase the number of reads that will map to the reference genome (here Human genome version 38), we need to preprocess the reads.

## Quality Control

The first step is to check the quality of the reads and the presence of the Nextera adapters. When we perform ATAC-Seq, two transposases could cut the DNA about 40 bp apart. This can be smaller than the sequencing length so we expect to have Nextera adapters at the end of those reads. We can do this with `FastQC`. The FastQC web page **Adapter Content** section shows the presence of Nextera Transposase Sequence in the reads. We will remove the adapters with Cutadapt.

## Trimming Reads

To trim the adapters we provide the Nextera adapter sequences to `Cutadapt`. These adapters are shown in the image below.

![Nextera library with the sequence of adapters](../../images/atac-seq/nexteraLibraryPicture.svg "Nextera library with the sequence of adapters")

The forward and reverse adapters are slightly different. We will also trim low quality bases at the ends of the reads (quality less than 20). We will only keep reads that are at least 20 bases long. We remove short reads (< 20bp) as they are not useful, they will either be thrown out by the mapping or may interfere with our results at the end.

# Mapping

## Mapping Reads to Reference Genome

Next we map the trimmed reads to the human reference genome. Here we will use `Bowtie2`. We will extend the maximum fragment length from 500 to 1000 because we know some valid pairs are from this fragment length. We will use the **--very-sensitive** parameter to have more chance to get the best match even if it takes a bit longer to run. We will run the **end-to-end** mode because we trimmed the adapters so we expect the whole read to map, no clipping of ends is needed.

# Filtering Mapped Reads

## Filter Reads

We apply some filters to the reads after the mapping. ATAC-seq datasets can have a lot of reads that map to the mitchondrial genome. The mitchondrial genome is uninteresting for ATAC-Seq, thus we remove these reads. We also remove reads with low mapping quality and reads that are not properly paired.

## Filter Duplicate Reads

Because of the PCR amplification, there might be duplicates (reads mapping to exactly the same genomic region) from overamplification of some regions. As the Tn5 insertion is random within an accessible region, we do not expect to see fragments with the same coordinates. We consider such fragments to be PCR duplicates. We will remove them with `Picard`.

## Check Insert Sizes

We will check the insert sizes (the distance between the first and second read) with `Picard CollectInsertSizeMetrics`. This gives a very good indication of the quality of the ATAC-Seq.

This fragment size distribution is a good indication if your experiment worked or not.
In absence of chromatin (without nucleosome), this is the profile you would get:

![Fragment size distribution of a purified DNA](../../images/atac-seq/Screenshot_sizeDistribution_Naked.png "Fragment size distribution of a purified DNA")

![Fragment size distribution of another purified DNA](../../images/atac-seq/Screenshot_sizeDistribution_Naked2.png "Fragment size distribution of another purified DNA")

Here are examples of Fragment size distributions of ATAC-Seq which were very noisy:

![Fragment size distribution of another failed ATAC-Seq](../../images/atac-seq/Screenshot_sizeDistribution_Failed2.png "Fragment size distribution of another failed ATAC-Seq")

A final example of a Fragment size distribution of a very good ATAC-Seq, even if we cannot see the third nucleosome "peak".

> FR stands for forward reverse orientation of the read pairs, meaning, your reads are oriented as -> <- so the first read is on the forward and the second on the reverse strand. RF stands for reverse forward oriented, i.e., <- ->. It really depends on your experiment, how your reads are oriented and if the orientation plays a role.

# Peak calling

## Call Peaks

We have now finished the data preprocessing. Next, in order to find regions corresponding to potential open chromatin regions, we need a tool that can identify differentially covered regions of the genome. That is to say, we want to identify regions where reads have piled up (peaks) greater than the background read coverage, to find out if some peaks are enriched. We use `Genrich` for that reason. It is very important at this point that we center the reads on the 5' extremity (where the Tn5 cut). You want your peaks around the nucleosomes and not directly on the nucleosome:
![Scheme of ATAC-seq reads relative to nucleosomes](../../images/atac-seq/schemeWithLegend.jpg "Scheme of ATAC-seq reads relative to nucleosomes")

If we only make a coverage of 5' extremities, the data would be too sparse and it would be impossible to call peaks. Thus, we will make a coverage of 5' extremities extended to 100 bp in each direction.

> This means that the 5' extremity of the read is not really the center of the staggered position but reads on the positive strand should be shifted 5 bp to the right and reads on the negative strands should be shifted 4 bp to the left. Here we are focusing on broad regions so we will not apply these shifts.

Thanks to `Genrich` we now have a coverage file which represents the coverage of the 5' extremities extended 100 bp to each side.
The output of `Genrich` is in a bedgraph format. It is easily readable for human (4 columns text format) but it can be very large and visualising a specific region is quite slow. We will change it to bigwig format which is a binary format, where we can visualise any region of the genome very quickly.

### Convert NarrowPeak to BED3
In order to visualize a specific region (e.g., the gene *YDJC*), we can either use a genome browser like `IGV` or `UCSC browser`, or use `pyGenomeTracks` to make publishable figures. We will use `pyGenomeTracks`. Currently `pyGenomeTracks` requires specific formats to be able to display peaks. We will convert the narrowPeak file from **Genrich callpeak** {% icon tool %} into a BED3 format (only 3 columns).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Convert peaks to BED3 format

> 1. **Cut** columns from a table {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Cut columns"*: `c1,c2,c3`
>    - *"Delimited by"*: `Tab`
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"From"*: Select the output of **Genrich** {% icon tool %} *"Peaks (encodepeak)"*.

### Sort Annotation and CTCF Regions
The tool **pyGenomeTracks** needs all bed files sorted, thus we sort the annotation file and the CTCF regions.

> 1. **bedtools SortBED** order the intervals {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"hg38.bed"*.

## Create heatmap of genes

You might also be interested in specific regions. For this, you can compute a heatmap. We will use the `deepTools plotHeatmap`. As an example, we will here make a heatmap centered on the transcription start sites (TSS).

### Generate computeMatrix

The input of `plotHeatmap` is a matrix in a hdf5 format. To generate it you will use the tool `computeMatrix` that will evaluate the coverage at each locus you are interested in.

## Plot with **plotHeatmap**

We will now generate a heatmap. Each line will be a transcript. The coverage will be summarized with a color code from red (no coverage) to blue (maximum coverage). All TSS will be aligned in the middle of the figure and only the 2 kb around the TSS will be displayed. Another plot, on top of the heatmap, will show the mean signal at the TSS.

# Conclusion

In this training you should have learned about the general idea of ATAC-Seq. ATAC-Seq
is a method to investigate the chromatin accessibility. The genome is treated with
a transposase (enzyme) called Tn5. It marks open chromatin regions by cutting and
inserting adapters for sequencing. The training material gave you an insight into the
quality control of the data. You should look for low quality bases, adapter contamination, correct insert size and PCR duplicates (duplication level). We showed you how to remove adapters and PCR duplicates, if `FastQC`, shows a warning in these areas. We mapped the reads
with `Bowtie2`, filtered our reads for properly paired, good quality and reads that do not
map to the mitochondrial genome. We found open chromatin regions with `Genrich`, which
is a tool to find differential covered regions (peak calling). We visualized the peaks and other informative tracks, such as CTCF binding regions and hg38 genes, with the help of `pyGenomeTracks`. Last but not least, we investigated the read coverage of our ATAC-Seq experiment around TSS with the help of `computeMatrix` and `plotHeatmap`. At the end, we found
open chromatin regions that overlapped with CTCF sites, which pronounce potential silencer regions that we have covered with our ATAC-Seq experiment. These regions are located in genes, but could also be upstream or downstream for some other genes.
